## Features

### Core Features

1. **Employee Management**
   - CRUD operations for managing employee data.
   - RESTful API endpoints (`/api/employees`) for interacting with employee resources.

2. **Security**
   - Basic authentication using Spring Security.
   - Authorization based on user roles (`USER` role for API access).

3. **Persistence**
   - Integration with H2 in-memory database for data storage.
   - JPA repository for handling database operations.

### Additional Features

- **DTOs and Mappers**
  - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for transferring data between layers.
  - MapStruct for efficient mapping between entities and DTOs.

- **Logging and Debugging**
  - SLF4J and Logback for logging critical application events and data transformations.
  - Debugging techniques to inspect data flow and application behavior.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the Spring Boot application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd your-project-directory
   mvn spring-boot:run

## 

Once the application is running, access the API endpoints via http://localhost:8080/api/employees.
Use tools like cURL, Postman, or Insomnia for testing API endpoints with authentication.
